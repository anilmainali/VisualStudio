This page and associated test script describes use of Visual Studio and the C# language to create a basic 
web service listener

This repo is equivalent to what repository https://github.com/heroku/node-js-sample
provides for the node.js web server written in JavaScript. 
The authors deployed that code to the website http://node-js-sample.herokuapp.com/.

Use an internet browser to open that web page and 
notice that it only displays a simple "Hellow World!".
This is because the example is "bare bones" and intended to work with web services between computers 
who have no need for animated cat gifs for amusement.


### <a name="WebServer"> Web Service Engines</a>
The README.md page for the node-js-sample repo begins by describing 
http://expressjs.com/
as its web services engine. 

It does for Node.js what Microsoft's IIS (Internet Information Server) does.

Walmart's subsidiary has also written a web services engine.
