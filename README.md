Here are my notes on using of VisualStudio from Microsoft for ensuring the performance and capacity of systems.

What else do I need to do to be an MVP on Performance Testing? ;)

## <a name="WhatEdition"> What Edition of Visual Studio?</a>

While it's true that there is a free ("Express") edition of the Visual Studio IDE,
(see 
Microsoft still sells MSDN licenses based on different editions of Visual Studio.

While it's true that source code Microsoft uses to create Visual is open-source on Github
(see https://visualstudio.github.com/),
additional features not in open source are still being sold as part of MSDN Visual Studio licenses.

One of those features is running load tests, which require the Ultimate edition of Visual Studio.

While it's true that Visual Studio is available online
(see https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/what-is-visual-studio-online-vs),
many developers still prefer to download and install Visual Studio on computers used to develop code,
where response time is near instantaneous.
